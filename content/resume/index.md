I am a senior software engineer with thorough hands on experience of over ten years in modern Web Development technologies (Angular, React, NodeJS, MongoDB) written in TypeScript. I have skills in rapid prototyping, design, implementation, and testing of software products – including user acceptance testing and TDD. I am passionate about software architecture and working with teams to develop beautiful and scalable applications. I have a great desire and willingness to grow and learn new things everyday (currently learning Deno!).
